A Mac OS X memory dump GUI controller for HP's 3577A spectrum analyzer.

The HP 3577Asupports remote interface via an HPIB controller. This repository contains the source code for building the Mac OS X app to retrieve contents of trace 1, trace 2, and registers 1 through 4, and saves the extracted values to a comma separated file. The executable program requires National Instruments GPIB-USB-HS adapter and installation of its software drivers and libraries.

Macintosh users can download the National Instrument GPIB drivers from http://www.ni.com/download/ni-488.2-3.0.1/2703/en/
